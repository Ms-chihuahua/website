## This will be the new QOM community website construction repository.

## Quick start using Hugo

> [!Note]
>  Ensure you have **Go** and **Hugo** installed, and that you have created a new Hugo project before proceeding.

1. From your project directory, initialize Hugo Modules:

```shell
hugo mod init github.com/qom-network/website
```

 2. Create `config/_default/module.toml` and add the following:

```
[[imports]]
path = "github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/v2"
```

 3. Start your server using `hugo server` and the theme will be downloaded automatically.

 4. In the root folder of your website, **delete the `hugo.toml` file that was generated by Hugo.** Copy the *.toml config files from the theme into your `config/_default/` folder.

> [!Note]
> Do not overwrite the module.toml file you created above!

You will find these theme config files in the Hugo `cache` directory, or download a copy from GitHub.

 5. Follow the [Getting Started](https://blowfish.page/docs/getting-started/) instructions to configure your website

## Installing theme updates

[](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish#installing-theme-updates)

As new releases are posted, you can update the theme using Hugo. Simply run `hugo mod get -u` from your project directory and the theme will automatically update to the latest release.

Detailed [update instructions](https://blowfish.page/docs/installation/#installing-updates) are available in the docs.
