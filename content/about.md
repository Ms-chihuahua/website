## What is the QOM Movement?
The QOM Movement is a community-driven initiative (CTO: Community Takeover) that implements cypherpunk principles — not just in words, but in code and infrastructure.

### Key Distinctions
- **BabelFish Protocol**: Underlying decentralized P2P tech.
- **QOM Network**: The ecosystem/platform built on BabelFish.
- **QOM (Quantum Operating Machine)**: The community movement (CTO).
- **QL1 (QOM Layer 1)**: The blockchain powering the ecosystem.

These distinctions help contributors navigate technology, governance, and content scope. (See: **QOM Network** overview & distinctions.) 

### Philosophy in Practice
Cypherpunks write code. QOM builds a sovereign internet layer and digital rights stack, prioritizing privacy, censorship resistance, and user agency.

### Where We’re Heading
- Informational site now; **security & account features later**.
- Open contribution model; lightweight governance; public reviews.
